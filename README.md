A school project building an application for car rental in PHP. Also using Javascript, Twig and MySQL.

## Built with:
PHP, Javascript, Twig and MySQL using VS-Code.

## Authors:
Stefan Ã…hlander

## Setup:
Update the config file with the correct credentials for your MySQL database and, if the application is not 
running in the root directory update the basUrl to the path to the directory where the index.php file
is stored.

Use the dump.sql file to set up the MySQL database, run the included commands on the database. The insert commands
are optional.

You should be good to go.

commented and should be fairly easy to follow.
